# Bioinformatics Tools

A collection of bioinformatics utilities and pipelines developed for reproducible, automated analysis workflows.

## Featured project: Short DNA read analysis pipeline

A complete, end-to-end analysis pipeline for short DNA sequencing reads (≤150 bp), designed for unattended execution and reproducibility.

**Key characteristics**
- One-command installation via shell script
- Explicit dependency management
- Deterministic, automated execution (no manual steps)
- Designed for use in HPC and batch-processing environments

**Pipeline location:**
