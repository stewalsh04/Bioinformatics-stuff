##What is this repository for?##
This repository contains a collection of NGS bioinformatic scripts, a folder contain R scirpts for statistical analysis and a fully functional bash pipeline to analyse short DNA sequence reads of up to 150bp.

I use this folder to store and share things that I have found useful with my bioinformatics and statistics work.
