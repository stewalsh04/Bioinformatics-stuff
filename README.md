## What is this repository for? ##

This repository contains a collection of NGS bioinformatic scripts, a folder containing R scirpts for statistical analysis and a fully functional bash pipeline to analyse short DNA sequence reads of up to 150bp.

I use this folder to store and share things that I have found useful within my bioinformatics and statistics work.

- The folder containing the R scripts has a dependency file and its own readme, simply install the packages within R studio.

- The short DNA sequence pipeline has its own detailed Readme along with it's own installer script that should handle dependancies within conda.
