This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# load data
lobster <- read_csv("~/Course_Materials/data/CS2-lobsters.csv")

# and have a look
lobster
```

```{r}
lobster %>% 
  group_by(diet) %>% 
  get_summary_stats(type = "common")
```

```{r}
ggplot(lobster,
       aes(x = diet, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
# Shapiro-Wilk test on each site
lobster %>% 
    filter(diet == "Mussels") %>% 
    pull(weight) %>% 
    shapiro.test()
```

```{r}
# define the model
lobsterlm <- lm(weight ~ diet,
                       data = lobster)
```

```{r}
# extract the residuals
resid_lobster <- residuals(lobsterlm)

# perform Shapiro-Wilk test on residuals
shapiro.test(resid_lobster)
```

```{r}
# check equality of variance

```{r}
