This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
spidermonkey <- read_csv("data/CS2-spidermonkey.csv")
spidermonkey
```

```{r}
spidermonkey %>% 
  select(-id) %>%
  group_by(familiarity) %>% 
  get_summary_stats(type = "common")
```

```{r}
ggplot(spidermonkey,
       aes(x = familiarity, y = aggression)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
# Shapiro-Wilk test on each site
spidermonkey %>% 
    filter(familiarity == "none") %>% 
    pull(aggression) %>% 
    shapiro.test()
```



```{r}
# perform Levene's test
levene_test(aggression ~ familiarity,
            data = spidermonkey)
```

```{r}
# implement Kruskal-Wallis test
kruskal.test(aggression ~ familiarity,
             data = spidermonkey)
```

```{r}
# perform Dunn's test
